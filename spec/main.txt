There are two types of server needed:
1. a watcher server that will watch a given folder, maintain an up-to-date list of its contents, and communicate changes to the master server.  There could be any number of these. See ./watcherServer.txt for more detail.
2. a master server that will listen for messages from the watchers, maintain an up-to-date, flat, deduplicated, sorted list of file names, and hand out this list when requested by an http GET request.  See ./masterServer.txt for more detail.
