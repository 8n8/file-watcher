The internal state of the master server is:

+ The set of files in each folder

+ The guid of the last update for each folder.

+ The master file list.

The master server does these things:

+ Hands out the latest version of the master file list when asked by the client.
+ Updates the folder file sets when updates come in, and respond with the guid of the last one.
+ Updates the master list whenever a watcher list is updated.
